          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <h3>PROBLEM:</h3>
          <p>Trust is a critical resource in policing. The public’s perception of law enforcement impacts not only the tenor of their direct interactions with officers but their general willingness to follow the law. Critical to that trust is a belief that law enforcement is acting in a just and consistent manner. Unfortunately, that belief is often informed by anecdote and gut feel far before it’s informed by actual data. </p>
          <h3>SOLUTION:</h3>
          <p>Team Indianapolis recognized an opportunity for strengthening that trust by providing information the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department already collects for internal use to the public in an informative, consumable format. Three of the most instructive datasets on the manner in which police do their jobs: complaints, uses of force and officer involved shootings are now available to the public direct from the internal tool the IMPD uses to track officers itself. </p>
          <h3>RESULTS:</h3>
          <p>Within 24 hours of the first launch of the site Team Indianapolis was already beginning to field questions about how residents of Indianapolis could use this data as the starting point for more conversations with the IMPD. Many residents were surprised that the IMPD was willing to be so open with this information and hoped that success with these data sets would lead to greater availability of Public Safety information across the board. The launch was timed to coordinate with Central Indiana’s launch of the nation’s first Regional Open Data Portal, tying together information from several cities. Residents were excited to see that the desire for transparency and Open Data extended broader than just the IMPD and that they could use the precedent-setting release of the valuable and sensitive IMPD data to encourage a greater number of sources of government data to push to the Open Data Portal.</p>
          <p>Since the launch, Team Indianapolis has been working on rolling out the toolset used to extract and present this data to other departments who use the same professional standards application.</p>

          <h2>City Environment</h2>

          <p>Indianapolis did not have a major <i>Civic</i> Technology scene before the start of the fellowship. The city did (and does) have a significant technology presence, supported by several large companies (in particular Angie’s List) and a growing startup scene. Many civic institutions, in addition to the mayor’s office, recognized prior to the fellowship the opportunity and the need for Indianapolis to grow their Civic Technology offerings. The Chamber of Commerce and mayor’s office both saw economic opportunity in providing greater access to civic data. In particular, they saw strong possibilities in using property and parcel data to ease and incentivize private action to revitalize the large number of vacant, abandoned and underutilized land and buildings in the city.  Plan 2020, the regional strategic planning organization, was also interested in using Civic Technology as a way to increase civic engagement of residents of the region, in particular, to secure the involvement of the technology community they were hoping to cultivate and grow. </p>

          <p>Our greatest champions once we arrived were Director of Constituent Services in the Mayor’s Office Hannah Bain and Chief of Homeland Security Gary Coons. Throughout the course of the project we came to rely a great deal on the assistance of the Deputy Director and Chief Financial Officer of the
Indianapolis Department of Public Safety Valerie Washington, the Executive Director of the Citizen Police Complaint Office Laura White, IMPD Chief Rick Hite and Major David Robinson of the IMPD’s Professional Standards Branch. Outside City Hall we were greatly assisted by Matt Kirby who now runs Indianapolis’ Brigade.

        <section id="process">
          <h2>The Process</h2>

          <p>While we spent our residency seeing a great deal of the public safety department’s wide range of work and the work of many adjacent groups (Code Enforcement, the Office of the Superintendent of IPS, &amp;c,) it quickly became clear that IMPD was where we could do the most good in the time we had. Many other parts of the city government we saw and talked with had great ideas for improvements or help they could use and choosing was naturally very difficult. Even within the IMPD there are a staggering number of groups and responsibilities all of which are critical and many of which, while operating at the high level Policing requires, still saw room for improvement.</p>
          <p>Outside of the IMPD potential projects we looked at included better methods of tracking transient and homeless school children, better prison reentry coordination between the Sheriff, community and non-profits and more modern asset tracking for the Indianapolis Fire Department and Public Safety Communications Department. Inside the IMPD, we heard a lot of great ideas for information radiators for disposition reports and missing property in squad rooms, better use of data coming from the computer aided dispatch and report management systems, better social media investigation tools and better sharing of all manner of information across districts, the department of public safety, code enforcement, the sheriff’s office, the courts and outside law enforcement agencies.</p>
          <p>Most of these ideas did not coalesce into solid project ideas. Some did however. Our first focus landed on the work of the Academy. The IMPD Academy relies on a variety of paper forms and outdated applications to complete their training of new officers and re-training of existing ones. In particular, we thought there was strong potential in digitizing one particular step of the new officer program: the Daily Field Observation Reports that are completed during the phase of a recruit’s training when they are out in the community doing real police work with a senior training officer. The potential in digitizing the forms not only would lessen the work of field trainers and staff but, we’d hoped, allow for a much greater level of analysis into what made recruits into successful officers and what made senior officers into successful trainers. Ultimately, we decided that the digitization effort was best handled by software firms that specialize in police academies and that there simply wasn’t enough data generated to do meaningful analysis in the timeline of the fellowship. We of course did not just speak with people in city government. Our frequent talks with community groups led us toward several other potential projects around blight tracking and abatement and better advocacy around sidewalk construction.</p>
          <p>Ultimately though our project came down to a brave decision by the IMPD and the Department of Public Safety to take advantage of an opportunity that Code for America helped open up to them. Thanks to 2012 Code for America City Partner and current Presidential Innovation Fellow Denice Ross Team Indianapolis and several representatives IMPD and  the Department of Public Safety had the privilege of attending a convening of police chiefs and members of the law enforcement community at the White House to discuss how technology in general and open data specifically can help strengthen trust and community relationships. The session was very productive and it helped immensely by highlighting a wide range of perspectives and experiences.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/data.jpg">
          </figure>
          <p>With the idea in mind that we wanted to build a site that would open up the most sensitive and important internal police data to residents, we quickly became familiar with the challenges we would be facing. Firstly, there was challenge of technical access to the information in a safe and secure manner. The IMPD sensibly restricts access to the systems (called IA Pro and Blueteam) to their internal network. Even then users of those systems are restricted to what information they can access. In our approach of integrating directly with the underlying databases for these tools, we had access to far more information than we wanted to release: officer and resident names, fined grained location details, information about on-going investigations, &amp;c. We worked closely with IMPD’s Professional Standards and Information Technology departments to craft a series of queries against these databases that ensured only the relevant information was extracted. Doing this in a manner that protected that information from even our team and partners was often challenging, but we recognized early that trust in this process was critical to the outcome of the project as well as the continued support we were enjoying from everyone in Public Safety.</p>
          <p>The next challenge we came across was how to translate the data we had been steeping in since Feburary into information that any resident of Indianapolis could immediately make sense of. We spent a lot of time on our return trips to Indianapolis identifying and meeting with groups of residents that we thought would be potentially interested in having access to this information. As time went on, we came back to these groups with paper prototypes that showed what data fields we were thinking of including and the language that go with those fields. Eventually those paper prototypes expanded into a list of every field released and our best explanation for what it meant. The hope is that after viewing these descriptions any user of the site can be as well versed in the meaning behind the language of Professional Standards and the Citizen’s Police Complaint Office as an employee of either would be.</p>
          <p>Once we had residents understanding what we were considering releasing we had to think about how to give them the entire picture. From the White House Convening onward, the notion of “context” was very important to our work. It’s not that raw numbers or csv rows  cannot tell a compelling story about the source they’re drawn from, it’s that they can tell any number of compelling stories, some of which may be disconnected from the reality of the sititution. Our focus condensed quickly around finding a set of “denominator” numbers, which would serve as an approximation of police/resident contacts in Indianapolis for a given time period. From there, we hoped that by providing that number we could effectively contextualize data like number of complaints or uses of forces to show that, while some police interactions can have negative outcomes, the vast majority do not. Deciding what this value should be comprised of and actually sourcing data on it (since the Professional Standards tools don’t track typical arrest or call for service data) proved difficult. Thankfully, we had built strong relationships with the Crime Analysts in the IMPD and their office had access to a wide range of this type of information and helped us a great in understanding what we were looking for and where to find it.</p>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>By far the largest challenge we faced in the end of the year was the looming end of Mayor Ballard’s term of office. Many of our biggest champions were appointed by Mayor Ballard and it was difficult to predict who would staying on for the next administration and who would be looking for other opportunities. While this slowed down some aspects of work (in particular selection of the Indianapolis Code for America Summit representation) more than enough of our partners at all levels of the city’s government had bought in and were willing to keep pushing forward on our project. We were very happy with the support we did receive from the civil servants who did step into roles temporary, especially Director of Public Safety Dr. David Wantz.</p>

        <section id="project">
          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p>With all of the great support we had from the IMPD and the Department of Public Safety, we were successfully able to launch our site <a href="www.projectcomport.org">Project Comport</a> over the course of a weekend in November, first through a preview event with the Indianapolis Brigade and several of the community groups we had met with preveiously followed by  a public unveiling at the Herron School of Art & Design on the Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis campus. The site features the three datasets we sourced from the internal Professional Standards tools, Citizen Complains, Uses of Force and Officer Involved Shootings, at two levels. Firstly, we provide a base level of examination of the data including visualizations for the most common questions we heard from residents. Secondly, we provide raw versions of our cleaned, privacy conscious data to be downloaded for further analysis by residents who wish to do so. Throughout the site, we’ve aimed to provide the context and explanatory content discussed above as close as possible to where it is the most relevant. Additionally, we’ve worked closely with Director White to allow for as much room as possible for the IMPD, CPCO and Public Safety to message to the public about the information we’re presenting. Director White provided an immense volume of information relating to department policy, process and programs that are relevant to our datasets. We’ve worked closely with her to ensure that that all gets translated into language residents not well versed in policing can understand. </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/comport.png">
          </figure>
          <p>Since the launch of the site, we’ve averaged around 300 sessions a month. We’ve benefited from direct media coverage from Statescoop, GCN and Govtech. Our preview event with the brigade had a few promising prototypes of what’s possible for technically adept residents to do with this data and we’re excited to see what becomes of those.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="other">
          <h2>Other Successes</h2>
          <p>The two major successes outside of Project Comport have been the start of an Indianapolis Brigade and the opening of the Indianapolis Regional Data Portal. Late in our residency, we met Matt Kirby and were very excited to find someone with such a strong vision for civic technology in Indianapolis, especially given its low profile in February. We only had a blizzard curtailed info session before leaving, but are overjoyed to see where the group is today. 237 people are registered on the group’s Meetup and after 8 strong meetings in 2015 they’re poised to continue their momentum in 2015. </p>
          <p>The other significant civic technology success with helped with was the opening of the Indianapolis Regional Data Portal. Indianapolis, Zionsville, Fishers and Greenwood came together to open a single Socrata-driven data portal for Central Indiana. In addition to providing data from Project Comport as a launch dataset, Team Indianapolis provided assistance through connections from the Code for America network of cities and the Sunlight Foundation. We were also able to leverage Indianapolis’ selection as a fellowship city to help gather support for the portal. It was fantastic to see Mayor Ballard’s office and specifically Director of Constituent Services Hannah Bain accomplish something of this magnitude in such a brief amount of time. Together with the strong Brigade, Civic Technology in Indianapolis is a much stronger force than when we first arrived. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="nextsteps">
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>The success of our project, we hope, will encourage more openness across the board in the Indianapolis city government but in particular in the Department of Public Safety. We hope that this project will demonstrate that transparency, even in sensitive areas, is a fantastic way for city hall to start conversations with residents and signal their desire for greater citizen oversight and participation. The city is especially primed to take advantage of open data with their new portal and an engaged and excited brigade. We have throughout our process made clear though while technology and open data can be excellent branches to extend, if Indianapolis wants to strengthen its relation between Public Safety and the community it serves, rebuilding trust in policing requires many different approaches and time. From what we can tell, the IMPD, the department of Public Safety and the residents of Indianapolis are incredibly enthusiastic and if willing and able to work together, should see Indianapolis become an example of what’s possible and positive in policing.</p>
